## üïπÔ∏è 2. Gameplay Summary
- **Core Loop**:
  - The player uses a ball to break blocks, revealing different pies. As the pies fall from these blocks, the player must collect them, then load them on to shipping trucks.
- **Win/Lose Conditions**:
  - Player wins the stage when:
    - They've broken all the boxes and collected and shipped enough pies to satisfy stage goals (i.e. ship 30 apple pies and 10 pumpkin pies, or ship $2000 worth of pies)
  - Player loses the stage when:
    - They've broken all the boxes, but not shipped enough pies to meet stage goals
    - They've let their block break ball drop too many times
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - Movement
    - Player moves character left and right to reflect the ball used to break blocks and catch falling pies
  - Inventory
    - Keep a count of each pie collected during the stage
    - Number of pies remaining for each shipping truck
    - Count of total pies shipped for each type
